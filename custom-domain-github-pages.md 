# 🌐 GitHub Pages Custom Domain Setup with GoDaddy

This guide documents how to set up a custom domain (e.g., `www.yourbrand.com`) from GoDaddy with GitHub Pages.

---

## ✅ Step 1: Buy a Domain (GoDaddy)

- Purchase a domain from [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com)
- Access the domain's **DNS Management** section

---

## ⚙️ Step 2: GitHub Pages Setup

1. In your **GitHub repository**, go to:
   - `Settings` → `Pages`
2. Choose a branch (`main`, `gh-pages`, etc.) and folder (`/root` or `/docs`)
3. Under **Custom Domain**, enter:  
   ```
   www.yourbrand.com
   ```
4. GitHub will auto-create a `CNAME` file in your repo.

---

## 📝 Step 3: Add `CNAME` File (Optional Manual Setup)

Create a file called `CNAME` at the root of your site folder with the contents:
```
www.yourbrand.com
```

---

## 🌐 Step 4: GoDaddy DNS Configuration

### 🔵 CNAME for www:
| Type  | Name | Value                    |
|-------|------|---------------------------|
| CNAME | www  | yourusername.github.io   |

### 🟢 A Records for root domain:
| Type | Name | Value             |
|------|------|-------------------|
| A    | @    | 185.199.108.153   |
| A    | @    | 185.199.109.153   |
| A    | @    | 185.199.110.153   |
| A    | @    | 185.199.111.153   |

> 🧠 "@" represents your root domain (e.g., `yourbrand.com`)

---

## 🔒 Step 5: Enforce HTTPS

Once DNS has propagated:
- Go to GitHub → `Settings → Pages`
- Enable: ✅ Enforce HTTPS

---

## ⚙️ Optional: GitHub Action for Auto Deploy (from Private Repo)

Create this file: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 18

      - name: Install & Build
        run: |
          npm install
          npm run build

      - name: Deploy
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./build
```

---

## ✅ Final Result

Your GitHub Pages site should now be accessible at:
```
https://www.yourbrand.com
```

---

## 📌 Notes

- Make sure the `CNAME` file is preserved on every deploy
- DNS propagation may take up to 30 minutes
- For redirecting root domain to `www`, use GoDaddy's "Forwarding" option
